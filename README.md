# Aahar – Food Donation App 🍽️

Aahar is an **Android-based food donation application** aimed at reducing food wastage and helping needy communities by connecting food donors with organizations and individuals in need.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

In highly populated countries like India, **food wastage is a serious and growing issue**. Streets, garbage bins, and landfills provide ample evidence of massive food waste generated daily from marriages, restaurants, canteens, social gatherings, and functions.

Food wastage is not only an indicator of hunger and pollution, but also highlights deeper **economic and environmental challenges**. Rapid lifestyle changes and rising living standards have led to excessive waste of food, clothes, books, and utensils.

Instead of discarding surplus food, it can be **donated to orphanages, old-age homes, NGOs, and homeless communities**, helping both society and the environment.
